#Normalization
Database normalization is the process of organizing the columns and tables of a relational database in a way that reduces data redundancy and improve data integrity. One of the benefits is tht it allows us to make changes in one place that then change throughout the entire database.

#Denormalization
Denormalization is a strategy used on a previously-normalized database to increase performance. The usual goal is to decrease the running time of select queries by making data more accessible to the queries or by generating summarized reports in separate tables. The main advantage is the increased performance, but disadvantages include taking up more space and data anamolies.
